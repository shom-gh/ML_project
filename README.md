Exploring the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Our notebooks in this repository placed us in the top 10% of the leaderboard at the top of submission.

The "latest3.0.ipynb" file contains the latest data preprocessing/cleaning discussion.

The "Kaggle_final" and MJC models files contain examples of code we used to run various models, stack them together, and evaluate them. Our best results were found using an ensemble of a regularized logistic model along with a gradient boosted tree (xgboost) model.
